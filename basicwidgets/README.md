## basicwidgets

In this repo I tried to develope a simple app structure which will walk you through the use of the basic widgets and theming. 
The basic widgets includes, container, row, column, flexible, wrap, and card. It also will walk you throuh the layout widgets such as stack and the use of position in it. What are you waiting for dive in 🏊‍♀️. 

See you tomorrow with some more cooking stuff 👨
